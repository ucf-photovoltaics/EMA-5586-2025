Now, you will evaluate different phosphorus concentration depth profiles to understand the relationship between recombination losses observed through the saturation current density ($J_{0E}$) and lateral transport losses observed through the sheet resistance, given as $R_{sheet}$ in the class and $\\rho_{sq}$ in EDNA.\n\nTo accomplish this, you will complete the following steps that consist of changing the peak doping concentration ($N_{peak}$) and dopant depth ($z_{f}$) using the complementary error function (erfc) function that approximates a phosphorus diffusion profile reasonably well. These values can be modifed in an actual diffusion step by changing the time and temperature during the $POCl_{3}$ diffusion process.","metadata":{},"id":"442ad24a-7bba-4c96-8140-ca33bdfc7a22","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Q1.1\nFirst, design a simulation study to evaluate the relationship between the model inputs, including:\n\n- $N_{peak}$\n- $z_{f}$\n\nand the model outputs, including:\n- $J_{0E}$\n- $R_{sheet}$ (given as $\\rho_{sq}$ in EDNA)\n \nDo this by creating a spreadsheet where each columns represents the input and output parameters.

A new paste supplier has emerged claiming they can reduce the line width and increase the height of the Ag grid lines, although the contact resistivity goes increase some. Use the [Grid Calculator](https://www2.pvlighthouse.com.au/calculators/Grid%20calculator/Grid%20calculator.aspx) from PV Lighthouse to see if this process is better.\n\nYour current paste aligns with default settings in the Grid Calculator, but you need to modify the contact resistivity ($\\rho_{c}$ in class and $R_{s contact}$ in the calculator) to 1 $m\\Omega$ $cm^{2}$ (note the units here and in the calculator). This should lead to a total $R_{s}$ contribution from the front grid of 0.105 $\\Omega$ $cm^{2}$ for the current paste.\n\nFor the new Ag paste alternative, the company can reduce the width of the grid line fingers from 100 $\\mu m$ down to 90 $\\mu m$ and increase the height from 30 $\\mu m$ to 50 $\\mu m$. However, the contact resistivity is two times higher now. Now, answer the following questions.\n\n## Q2.1\nWhat is total $R_{s}$ contribution from the front grid with this new paste?\n\n## Q2.2\nAre there any other obvious advantages or disadvantages you would anticipate by adopting this new paste based on these metrics? You can assume it would be very easy to integrate this paste into your manufacturing line, so do not worry about added process development costs.\n\n## Q2.3\nHow would you about calculating the new efficiency of PV cells made from this alternative paste? Please consider all relevant loss mechanisms related to this specific problem and walk through each step of the process.
